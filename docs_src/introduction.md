# Confluent Secrets Provider

Last update: September 24, 2021 (v1.0.1)

## Introduction

With a typical Confluent Kafka Platform installation, secrets are stored within that cluster only.

This Confluent CSID Accelerator enables use of external third-party systems for securely storing and retrieving key/value pairs, commonly used for passwords, for example.
In some cases, this can be used to store symmetric keys and asymmetric (public/private) keys.
